# Digit Classifier

This project can be used to recognize digits from 0 to 9 in any image after preprocessing the digis image into a normalized matrix. This is done using training machine learning model via neural network.

## Getting Started

for running project simply download the project on your machine and run submit.R file on R-studio. To predict the digit,you can feed your image matrix also.

### Prerequisites

you only need Rtools installed on your machine and have preprcessed matrix of digits-image. 
for examples you should have preprocessed image matrix which can be easily obtained from MNIST.
